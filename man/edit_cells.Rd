\usage{
edit_cells(ss, ws, anchor = "A1", input = "", by_row = FALSE,
  header = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ss}{a registered Google spreadsheet}

\item{ws}{positive integer or character string specifying index or title,
  respectively, of the worksheet to consume}

\item{anchor}{single character string specifying the upper left cell of the
cell range to edit; positioning notation can be either "A1" or "R1C1"}

\item{input}{new cell values, as an object that can be coerced into a
character vector, presumably an atomic vector, a factor, a matrix or a
data.frame}

\item{by_row}{logical; should we fill cells across a row (\code{by_row =
TRUE}) or down a column (\code{by_row = FALSE}, default); consulted only
when \code{input} is a vector, i.e. \code{dim(input)} is \code{NULL}}

\item{header}{logical; indicates whether column names of input should be
included in the edit, i.e. prepended to the input; consulted only when
\code{length(dim(input))} equals 2, i.e. \code{input} is a matrix or
data.frame}

\item{verbose}{logical; do you want informative message?}
}
\description{
Modify the contents of one or more cells. The cells to be edited are
specified implicitly by a single anchor cell, which will be the upper left
corner of the edited cell region, and the size and shape of the input. If the
input has rectangular shape, i.e. is a data.frame or matrix, then a simiarly
shaped range of cells will be updated. If the input has no dimension, i.e.
it's a vector, then \code{by_row} controls whether edited cells will extend
from the anchor across a row or down a column.
