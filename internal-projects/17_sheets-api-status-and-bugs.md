On 2015-07-29 the Sheets REST API went down. See [issue #153 ](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/issues/153) here and [Issue 3939](https://code.google.com/a/google.com/p/apps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=3939&q=Type%3DDefect%20API%3DSpreadsheets&colspec=Stars%20Opened%20ID%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20API%20Owner) at Google.

As a result of that I learned the following, which maybe handy in future:

  * [apps-api-issues](https://code.google.com/a/google.com/p/apps-api-issues/) is a general landing page: "a place to report issues with the Google Apps APIs"
  * there's a section for the Sheets API, with links to
    - the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/) *obviously I've known about this for a while and have read the whole damn thing*
    - the [list of bugs](https://code.google.com/a/google.com/p/apps-api-issues/issues/list?can=2&q=Type%3DDefect+API%3DSpreadsheets) *bugs and issues seems to be used interchangeable in the vocabulary of this site*
    - the [list of feature requests](https://code.google.com/a/google.com/p/apps-api-issues/issues/list?can=2&q=Type%3DEnhancement+API%3DSpreadsheets)
    - form to file new bug or feature request
