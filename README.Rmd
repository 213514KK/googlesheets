Google Spreadsheets R API
---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jennybc/gspreadr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jennybc/gspreadr)

Manage your spreadsheets with *gspreadr* in R. 

*gspreadr* is patterned after [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread), a Google Spreadsheets Python API


Features:

-   Open a spreadsheet by its **title** or **url**.
-   Extract range, entire row or column values.

![gspreadr](README-gspreadr.png)

Basic Usage
---
```{r load library}
library(gspreadr)
```
```{r basic usage, eval = FALSE}
# See what spreadsheets you have
list_spreadsheets()

# Open a worksheet from spreadsheet with one shot
ws <- open_at_once("Temperature", "Sheet1")

update_cell(ws, "B2", "January")

# Fetch a cell range
df <- read_range(ws, "A1:B7")

```

Authorization
---
##### Authorization using OAuth2 (recommended)
```{r authorize, eval = FALSE}
# Give gspreadr permission to access your spreadsheets and google drive
authorize() 
```

##### Alternate authorization: login with your Google account

```{r login, eval = FALSE}
login("my_email", "password")
```
  
More Examples

### Opening a spreadsheet

```{r open spreadsheet, eval = FALSE}
# You can open a spreadsheet by its title as it appears in Google Drive
ssheet <- open_spreadsheet("Gapminder")
```

##### Usually for public spreadsheets (set visibility = "public" for public spreadsheets): 
```{r public spreadsheet, eval = FALSE}
# Open a spreadsheet by its key 
ssheet <- open_by_key("1hS762lIJd2TRUTVOqoOP7g-h4MDQs6b2vhkTzohg8bE")

# You can also use the entire URL
ssheet <- open_by_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hS762...")
```

```{r open public spreadsheet, include = FALSE}
ssheet <- open_by_url("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hS762lIJd2TRUTVOqoOP7g-h4MDQs6b2vhkTzohg8bE/pubhtml", visibility = "public")
```

```{r}
# See the structure
str(ssheet)
```

### Creating and Deleting a spreadsheet

```{r create and delete spreadsheet, eval = FALSE}
# Create a new spreadsheet by title
add_spreadsheet("New Spreadsheet")

# Move spreadsheet to trash
del_spreadsheet("New Spreadsheet")
```

### Opening a worksheet

```{r open worksheet}

# Get a list of all worksheets
list_worksheets(ssheet)

# You can open a worksheet by index. Worksheet indexes start from one.
ws <- open_worksheet(ssheet, 1)

# By title
ws <- open_worksheet(ssheet, "Africa")

# See the structure
str(ws)
```

### Viewing a worksheet
```{r one-worksheet, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
# Take a peek at your worksheet
view(ws)
```
```{r all-worksheets}
# Take a peek at all the worksheets in the spreadsheet
view_all(ssheet)
```

### Creating and Deleting a worksheet

```{r create and delete worksheet, eval = FALSE}
# Create a new worksheet
add_worksheet(ssheet, title = "foo", rows = 10, cols = 10)

# Delete worksheet
new_ws <- open_worksheet(ssheet, "foo")
del_worksheet(new_ws)
```

### Renaming a worksheet

```{r rename a worksheet, eval = FALSE }
rename_worksheet(ssheet, old_title = "Old Name", new_title = "Cooler Name")
```

### Getting all values from a row or range of rows

```{r get row(s)}
get_row(ws, 3)

get_rows(ws, from = 2, to = 5, header = TRUE)
```

### Getting all values from a column or range of columns
```{r eval = FALSE}
one_col <- get_col(ws, 1)

many_cols <- get_cols(ws, from_col = 1, to_col = 3)
```

### Getting a region of a worksheet
```{r get region}

# By boundary rows and cols
read_region(ws, from_row = 1, to_row = 5, from_col = 1, to_col = 6)

# By range
read_range(ws, "A1:F5")
```

### Getting the entire worksheet
```{r eval = FALSE}
all_my_data <- read_all(ws)
```

### Getting all worksheets from a spreadsheet as a list of worksheet objects
```{r eval = FALSE}
my_ws <- open_worksheets(ssheet)
```

### Getting a cell value

```{r getting a cell value}
# With label
get_cell(ws, "B2")

# With coordinates
get_cell(ws, "R2C2")
```

### Finding cells
```{r find cell(s)}
# find a cell with value (cell of first appearance)
find_cell(ws, "Algeria")

# find all cells with value
find_all(ws, "Algeria")
```

### Updating cells 
```{r eval, eval = FALSE}
# update a single cell
update_cell(ws, "B4", "Oops")

get_cell(ws, "B4")

# Update cells in batch - specify range
update_cells(ws, "A1:C1", c("Country", "Continent", "Year"))

read_range(ws, "A1:C1")

# Update cells in batch - specify anchor cell
update_cells(ws, "D1", c("Life Expectancy", "Population", "GDP Per Capita"))

read_range(ws, "D1:F1")
```

```{r return to normal, include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
update_cells(ws, "A1", c("country", "continent", "year", "lifeExp", "pop", "gdpPercap"))
update_cell(ws, "B4", "Africa")
```
