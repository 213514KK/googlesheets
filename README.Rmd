Google Spreadsheets R API
---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jennybc/gspreadr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jennybc/gspreadr)

Manage your spreadsheets with *gspreadr* in R. 

*gspreadr* is inspired by [gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread), a Google Spreadsheets Python API


Features:

  - Access a spreadsheet by its title, key or URL.
  - Extract data or edit data.
  - Add | delete | rename spreadsheets and worksheets.

![gspreadr](README-gspreadr.png)

Basic Usage
---
```{r load-package}
library(gspreadr)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
```
```{r basic-usage}
# See what spreadsheets you have
# (expect to authenticate with Google interactively HERE)
list_spreadsheets()

# Hey let's look at the Gapminder data
gap <- register("Gapminder")
str(gap)

# Oh, you don't own it? Access it by key!
gap <- register("1hS762lIJd2TRUTVOqoOP7g-h4MDQs6b2vhkTzohg8bE")

# Get the data for Oceania: the fast tabular way
oceania_list_feed <- get_via_lf(gap, ws = "Oceania") 
str(oceania_list_feed, give.attr = FALSE)
oceania_list_feed

# Get the data for Oceania: the slower cell-by-cell way
oceania_cell_feed <- get_via_cf(gap, ws = "Oceania") 
str(oceania_cell_feed, give.attr = FALSE)
head(oceania_cell_feed, 10)
oceania_reshaped <- gspreadr:::reshape_cf(oceania_cell_feed)
str(oceania_reshaped, give.attr = FALSE)
head(oceania_reshaped, 10)
```

Authorization
---
##### Authorization using OAuth2 (recommended and auto-triggered in many cases)
```{r authorize, eval = FALSE}
# Give gspreadr permission to access your spreadsheets and google drive
authorize() 
```

##### Alternate authorization: login with your Google account

```{r login, eval = FALSE}
login("my_email", "password")
```
  
Stuff we are in the process of bringing back online after the Great Refactor of February 2015

  * convenience wrappers for the cell feed, i.e. row(s), column(s), range
  * edit cells
  * add/delete spreadsheets
  * add/delete/rename worksheets
  * visual overview of which cells are populated
  * finding a cell ?will we even do this?
